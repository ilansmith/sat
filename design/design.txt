Introduction
============
definition - The SAT decision problem: 

    Given preicate P in CNF form, is P satisfyable?

The sat application decides instances of SAT. Moreover, for each predicate P 
in SAT, it produces all the possible assignments to P's variables that satisfy 
P. The SAT problem is an NP-complete problem. A trivial algorithm for solving 
an instatnce of the SAT problem is to enumerate all possible assginments to its 
variables and to test each assginment for satisfaction of the predicate. The 
solution to the SAT problem provided by the sat application is based on this 
algorithm. The solution discussed in [1] is for the K-SAT problem (where each 
clause in the CNF predicate is of a constant length: K). The sat application 
extends the solution to solving any instatnce of SAT. It also supports CNF 
expressions with clauses in which there are multiple instatnces of one or more 
variables. The techneque is to break the SAT the problem into small 
subproblems - each possible assignment is carried by a self replicating loop 
in a cellular automata environment. Artifitial selection is used to remove 
loops carrying non satisfying assignments. More on the CA environment is found 
in [1].

The sat application uses an event loop to provide a multi tasked single 
threaded environment. The implementation of the cellular space differs slightly 
from the clasic definition of CA space in that it is event driven. That is, 
most cells are in a dormant state and are not active during iteration. Only 
cells on the loops, or on the extentions of replicating loops are active and 
change their state from iteration to iteration.

Event Loop
==========
The event loop provides a signle tasked, multithreaded, event drivern 
environment as the infrestructure of the application.
The event loop consists of a queue of event data/function pairs waiting to be
exectuted. When the event loop becomes empty, the application terminates. Events
can be triggered by setting signals.
Before starting the event loop, event handlers must be registered, initial tasks
and file descriptors (fd's are not relevant to this application) must be added. 
Before starting the event loop event_init() must be called. The event loop is 
started by calling event_loop(), and at its completion event_uninit() must be 
called for cleanup.

Two signals are defined:
SIG_LOOP: a self replicating loop has either been removed or has matured.
SIG_ERROR: used only to handle unsuccessful memory allocations.

The event loop necessary structures and API can be found in event.h.


Input Reception - options
=========================
The application can be started recieving the following options:
-p: recieve input predicate from command line. required argument: "<predicate>"
-f: recieve input from file. required argument: <file_name>
-n: no printing
-o: print code field (default)
-d: print direction field
-l: print flag field
-c: print colour field
-s: slow iteration speed
-m: medium iteration speed
-r: rapid iteration speed
-h: help message
-e: restore cursor


CNF Parser
==========
The CNF parser implements the following regular expression/automaton:

CNF regulare expression
-----------------------
WS:              ' ' | '\t'
LPAREN:          '('
RPAREN:          ')'
NEGATION:        '-'
UNDERSCORE:      '_'
ALPHA:           ['a' - 'z'] | ['A' - 'Z']
NUMERIC:         ['0' - '9']
VARIABLE_PREFIX: UNDERSCORE | ALPHA
VARIABLE_SUFFIX: (UNDERSCORE | ALPHA | NUMERIC)*
(*) VARIABLE:    VARIABLE_PREFIX VARIABLE_SUFFIX
LITERAL:         NEGATION? VARIABLE
CLAUSE:          LPAREN WS* LITERAL WS* (WS or WS WS* LITERAL WS*)* RPAREN
CNF:             WS* CLAUSE WS* (WS and WS WS* CLAUSE WS*)*

(*) 'and' and 'or' are reserved words and cannot be used as VARIABLEs.

The CNF parser in sat_parser.c implements the following automaton:

During parsing, new clauses found throughout the CNF expression and new 
literals found in each clause are managed by using the clause_new() and
literal_new() callbacks passed on the provided parser_cb_t. The clause_new() 
callback is called in st_clause_start() state and the literal_new() callback is 
called in the st_literal() state. These callbacks are used to create a list of 
clauses consisting of lists of literals - later to be used when creating the 
SAT table which I discuss later.

The parser recieves success and fail callbacks in the parser_cb_t provided and 
utilizes the event loop to jump from state to state and to exit with success or 
failure.

As well as the callbacks, the parser recieves a character stream on which it
operates. The character stream is a generic wrapper to input provided either in
a file or as a string on the command line.

On failure, the parser sets its error_no apropriately and calls the st_error()
function which in turn, produces the correct error message describing the
failure reason.

If parsing completes succesfuly, then from this point on no errors are expected.
The only event that could yield an error is unsuccessful memory allocation.

SAT Table
=========
SAT variables
-------------
SAT expression variables can be any alphanumeric expression with the first
letter being non numeric.

During CNF expression parsing, each encountered variable is added to a list of
varible_t structures that map between variable names and assigned integer ids.

Variables are added to the variable list using the function variable_add(),
while the list is cleared by calling variable_clr().

SAT table
---------
The monitorring system, as is discussed later, removes loops carrying non
satisfying assignemnts. It does so by seeking assignments satisfying the
negation of the CNF expression. The SAT table is the data struture that stores
each clause's literals and their negated truth value sign for recognition by the
monitor. Its structure is as follows:
legend:
- n: number of clauses
- k: longest length (number of variables in) of clause
- id[p][q]: id of the variable in clause p, position q
- tv[p][q]: negated truth value of variable id[p][q]

                 dummy    clause 1   clause 2   clause 3   ...   clause n
              +---------+----------+----------+---------+       +---------+
pos 1: id     |    0    | id[1][1] | id[2][1] | id[3][1]         id[n][1] |
truth value   | paradox | tv[1][1] | tv[2][1] | tv[3][1]         tv[n][1] |
              +---------+----------+----------+---------+       +---------+
pos 2: id     |    0    | id[1][2] | id[2][2] | id[3][2]         id[n][2] |
truth value   | paradox | tv[1][2] | tv[2][2] | tv[3][2]         tv[n][2] |
              +---------+----------+----------+---------+       +---------+
pos 3: id     |    0    | id[1][3] | id[2][3] | id[3][3]         id[n][3] |
truth value   | paradox | tv[1][3] | tv[2][3] | tv[3][3]         tv[n][3] |
              +---------+----------+----------+---------+       +---------+
 .
 .
 .
              +---------+----------+----------+---------+       +---------+
pos k: id     |    0    | id[1][k] | id[2][k] | id[3][k]         id[n][k] |
truth value   | paradox | tv[1][k] | tv[2][k] | tv[3][k]         tv[n][k] |
              +---------+----------+----------+---------+       +---------+

The table is created in two stages:
1. A list of clauses is created during expression parsing.
   Each clause consists of a list of the literals it is made up of. During this
   process, the variables are mapped to numeric ids which are used for the
   actual computation. At successful completion of the computation the numeric
   values are mapped back to alphanumeric names when providing the output.
   The functions for creating new clauses and literals are passed by the sat
   application as callbacks to the parser.
2. The position table is created after successful parsing by using the clause 
   list created in the previous stage. In this stage, all values of the literals
   are negated to corresopnd to the negated CNF expression.
   The ids in the first collum in of the table are set to 0s and their truth
   values to paradox. This is required for technical reasons.
   Clauses with less than k literals are padded in the higher positions with 
   literals of id 0 and truth value tautology since a monitor scanning this far 
   into the clause implies acceptance of the assignment by the negated CNF 
   expression. Clauses in which a literal appears twice with opposite signs 
   will have one instance of that variable in the first position it appears. 
   Such a variable's truth value will be set to paradox, as such a clause can 
   never be accepted by the negated CNF expression. 
   For example: !(a or -a) --> (-a and a), which is a paradox.
More on the monitorring proccess and how the SAT table is used is disccussed
later.

Cellular Space
==============
Cellular Space Initialization
-----------------------------
As the cellular space is a sphere, it is not important where in the space the
initial configuration is set. For cosmetic reasons, the initial configuration 
is set one loop size to the south west of the cellular spaces's center. Note 
that the implementation suggest in [1] the initial configuration is set at the 
bottom left of the cellular space.
For a SAT expression with n variables
- the celluar space dimention is given by: Dsp = (2n + 1) * (n + 2)/3 + 6n + 2
- the loop dimention is given by: Dlp = (n + 8)/3
- the loop length is given by: Llp = 4(Dlp - 1)
- the bottom left cell of the initial configuration is given by
  - x dimention: X = (Dsp/(2(Dlp + 1)) - 1) * (Dlp + 1)
  - y dimention: Y = Dsp - 1 - X
The initial values of all fields is decribed in [1] and is set by
sp_initial_configuration() in sat_ca.c. The only deviation from what is 
described is that sat sets the colour field of the non quiescent cells to red. 
This is not an algormthmic requirement, it simply provides for better output 
when running sat with the -c option.

Iteration and Signalling
------------------------
A full iteration performed by a cellular automaton consists of two stages: 
scanning and applying.
During scanning, the CA scans its and its neighbours' states and decides the
action to be taken in order to transform to its next state. During application,
the CA transforms from its current state to its next state.
It is imperitive that in each iteration all CAs complete scanning before any
of them perform application.
Unlike in the clasic cellular automata model, the sat cellular automaton is
event driven. That is, mostly it is only non quiescent cells that perform 
scanning and application during iteration, whilst quiescent cells do not. 
Exceptions to this are quiescent cells on a loop being replicated.
In general, two event loop calls (registrations) are required per automaton to
complete its full iteration. During the first event call, the automaton performs
its scan and sets the application function as a callback to be executed at its
next event call. Once called a second time and completing the application, the
automaton sets the scan function once again to be called during the next 
iteration. In the cases of changing a quiescent cell to grow (both ahead and in 
the left direction) and creating an extention for replication it is the 
responsabilty of the neighbour due to which the cell is becoming active to
register it on the event loop. This is done in the following functions once the 
neighbour completes its application:
- code_set_grow()
- code_set_turn_left()
- code_set_arm_ext_start()
Cells on loops being removed ether by the selection proccess (monitoring) or due
to loop collision refrain from re-registering themselves on the event loop. 
This is done in:
- bound_rules_scan() if a degenerating (remove loop or collision) flag is set
The scan-apply method guarentees that all active CAs complete their scanning
before any perform application. This is true, since starting at the initial
configuration, prior to each iteration, all the active cells are registerd on
the event loop with the scanning callback. Any further registrations on the
event loop occur after the last active cell's scanning registration. That is,
all applications schedualed by the scanning are registered in the event loop
after the last active cell's scan. Only once the last cell completes its
scanning does the event loop reach the application functions. Similarly, all
applications are carried out one by one before any of the newly registered
scans can be called. When the last application is called and executed, the
iteration is complete and the event loop is rendered queued with all the active
cells and the scanning function - ready for the next iteration.
It is important to note that for printing, both sat_print() and sat_print_set()
functions are required - corresponding to the scan-apply functions described
above. Printing the cellular space is typically done before a new iteration by 
the sat_print() function (with the exception of the initial scan this is 
directly after all applications have been executed). The sat_print() function 
must register the sat_print_set() function. It does so directly before the 
first scan of the next iteration is performed. The sat_print_set(), in turn, 
is executed directly before any of the application functions are called and 
simply registers the sat_print() function once more in the event loop. This 
guarentees that sat_print() will be called directly after all applications are 
executed and before the next iteration.

CA Rules
--------
The CA rules are based on those defined in [3]. The main changes are in the
- monitor spreading mechanism
- activating previously quiescent cells
- completion detection
The CA is defiend by the ca_t struct:

typedef struct ca_t {
    struct ca_t *neighbours[8];
    ca_code_t code;
    ca_direction_t dir;
    ca_colour_t col;
    ca_flag_t flag;
    int id;
    monitor_t mon;
    void *loop;
} ca_t;

The CA's state is defined by the combined states of its code, dir, col, flat, 
id fields, as well as its monitoring state. All application actions are set as
call backs for the next round of events as described above.
All these fields are reset in quiescent cells.
The progression through the rule set commences with scannig the flag field as
follows:
- if any of the destruction flags are set reset the flag. else
- if ca is bound and there is a destruction flag nearby, set the destruction 
  flag. else
- if a collision flag nearby copy the retracting flag until raching a corner, 
  then set the branch sequence flag. else
- if the replication arm is closing on itself set the flag to mutate a new one 
  bit. else
- check arm extrusion failure. a failed attempt at new arm etrusion will result 
  in the FL_BRANCH_SEQ flag being set in the cornder. this allows further 
  attempts at the other directions later. else
- if a CD_TURN_LEFT is near by change FL_GEN_ZERO to FL_GEN_ONE  in order to 
  mutate a new one bit. else
- if CD_ARM_EXT_START clear the flag. else
- if FL_GEN_ONE/FL_GEN_ZERO reset to either FL_QUIESCENT or FL_BRANCH_SEQ. else
- if id != 0, do monitor scanning (described later):
  - if success, deactiveate montor
  - if active, set flag to monitor active
  - if allert, set flag to monitor allert
  - if fail, set erase loop

Following the flag scanning state scanning precedes with either bound rule set
or unbound ruleset depending on the whether the cell is quiescent or not.
bound rules:
- if any of the detruction flags is set, reset all fields. else
- if a CD_GROW is seen CD_QUIESCENT state changes to CD_FLOW. else
- if a CD_DETACH sees a FL_GEN_ZERO nearby it disappears. else
- if a closing loop is detected, set the CD_DETACH code. else
- if a detach code is seen close the child loop. else
- if a FL_BRANCH_SEQ is seen generate an arm extention sequence. else
- if state is arm extention start then complete the arm extention sequence. else
- if on a loop corner do not copy do not copy arm extention start round it. else
- if on a loop corner do not copy do not copy arm extention end round it. else
- if CD_UNEXPLORED_0/CD_UNEXPLORED_1 convert to CD_ZERO/CD_ONE. else
- if monitror is active and code is 0 or 1 and pionting neighbour's code is flow
  set the loop's success flag
unbound rules:
- if there's a CD_GROW nearby CD_QUIESCENT changes to CD_FLOW. else
- initiate an arm extention if needed. else
- turn the flowing dirction due to CD_TURN_LEFT if needed. else
